# Basic modular flight simulator

[![Maintainability](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/00a0ae43c6c8099f1487/maintainability)](https://codeclimate.com/github/Duxy1996/GAIA-project/maintainability)

In this project our final goal is to set up a basic modular flight simulator to improve the VR
experiences trying to mix some new techonlogies. To build the applications are using for the 3D
management ThreeJS (A-Frame) and we want to use GO/GIN to host the server and React to build the interfaces.

We are creating this repo to develop a basic scaffold to build your own flight models, radars, planes
weapon maagement and even the IOS management. Furthermore we want to make a server to do a multi-lan connections
for the same simulation rom.

* [ ] VR Cockpit for EF
* [ ] Basic IOS controller
* [X] Basic Flight model
* [ ] Basic avionics calculos
* [ ] Basic weapon system
* [ ] Multiplatform service
* [ ] GO/GIN based application
* [ ] React based interface manager√ß
* [ ] Implement CI with travis
* [ ] Artefact lib with CONAN
* [ ] Fast deploy with Docker
* [ ] ThreeJS model management (A-Frame framawork used)
* [ ] ...

The progress:
